## Introduction
This project explores migration patterns within India and globally. Using data-driven analysis, we aim to understand key trends, factors influencing migration, and the socio-economic impact. The project involves data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of migration flows.

## Objective
The objective is to identify and visualize migration trends, uncover key insights, and present a clear understanding of patterns in population movement over time.
